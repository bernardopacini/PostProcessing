===============

This repository is a collection of utilities and techniques for post-processing aerospace related analyses and optimizations.
While the utilities are intended to be general, they are built for applications related to aerodynamics, aeroacoustics, and structures.
The methods are organized by tool type and some may require licenses.

The methods are organized in following structure:
